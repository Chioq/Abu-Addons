# Abu-Addons

### Summary
A collection of Abu (oUF_Abu) addons for World of Warcraft.

The sole purpose of this repository is to keep these addons up-to-date with the latest version of the game while ease the process of finding compatible addon dependency (oUF).

Updated to game version: **v9.0.1**

### General
Abu was originally developed by [Sticklord](https://github.com/Sticklord), who delivered a fantastic set of addons to offer an alternative to Blizzard UI while remained authentic yet clean and rich of useful features.
As the original author stopped updating Abu addons, consecutive API changes led several of these addons become incompatible with the latest versions of the game.

Using oUF_Abu for years made me personally realize I would not want to switch to use any other unit frames, therefore I would like to help Abu fans like me of the WoW community by keeping these addons up-to-date as frequently as possible.

### Supported addons
oUF_Abu & oUF_AbuOptions

### Planned activities
- Provide fix for Abu addons which have not been updated since long time and became incompatible with the game
- Update supported addons to work with game versions in the future
- Quality of life changes to supported addons

### Thanks to
